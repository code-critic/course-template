# Course year

Every course can be split into `years`. A `year` (in this case **2019**) holds a problems 
and also the results submitted by the students.


A structure is as follows:
```txt
2019
├── problems
│   ├── problem-1
│   ├── problem-2
│   └── problem-n
└── results
    ├── problem-1
    ├── problem-2
    └── problem-n
```
